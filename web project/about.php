	We usually come across hotel rating websites where users are allowed to rate hotel comment on hotel online. These ratings are provided as
	input to the website admin. The admin then checks reviews, criticâ€™s ratings and displays an online rating for every hotel. 

<br/><br/>Similarly Here In Transportation Rating System we propose an online system that automatically allows users to post reviews about transportation 
services  and store them. The system now analyzes this data to check for user sentiments associated with each comment. Our system consists of a sentiment library. The system breaks user comments to check for sentiment keywords. Once the keywords are found it associates the comment with a sentiment rank. The system now gathers all comments for a particular transportation ( for example: bus,train,plane etc) and then calculates an average ranting to score it. 
This score is generated for every transports in the system. This provides an automated transport rating system based on sentiment analysis.
